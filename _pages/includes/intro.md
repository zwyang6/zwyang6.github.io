Hi! My name is Zhiwei Yang. I'm a Ph.D. student at Academy for Engineering and Technology of <i class="fas fa-university"></i> **Fudan University**. I am now working on Multimodal Perception, Weakly-supervised Learning and Medical Image Processing.

üåà **I am now seeking intership and formal job opportunities in MLLMs applicationsÔºÅ** Please feel free to email zhiwei at [zwyang.research@gmail.com](mailto:zwyang21@m.fudan.edu.cn) and get more familiar with me from [My CV](images/resume/yzw_resume.pdf).

I am currently a member of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention <i class="fab fa-microsoft"></i> **MICCAI Lab**, co-supervised by <a href="https://swang.miccai.cloud/">Prof. Shuo Wang</a> and <a href="https://miccai.fudan.edu.cn/34225/list.htm">Prof. Zhijian Song</a>.
Prior to this, I received the B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2021, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sTQwwu4AAAAJ">Prof. Yanjie Wang</a>.

My research interest includes Multimodal Perception, Weakly-supervised Learning and Meical Image Processing. I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e_lRvJ8AAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fzwyang6%2Fzwyang6.github.io%2Fgoogle-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals such as CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, MICCAI, TMM. 

My works include [SeCo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18467), [ExCEL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20826), [MoRe](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11076), and [UniA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08195).
