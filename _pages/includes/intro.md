Hi! My name is Zhiwei Yang. I'm a Ph.D. student at the Academy for Engineering and Technology of <i class="fas fa-university"></i> **Fudan University**. I am now working on Multimodal Perception, Weakly-supervised Learning and Medical Image Processing.

üåà **I am actively seeking intership and full-time opportunities in MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) applicationsÔºÅ** Please feel free to reach out via email [zwyang.research@gmail.com](mailto:zwyang21@m.fudan.edu.cn). You can also get to know me from [My CV](https://github.com/zwyang6/zwyang6.github.io/blob/master/images/resume/yzw_resume.pdf).

I am currently a member of the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention <i class="fab fa-microsoft"></i> **MICCAI Lab**, co-supervised by <a href="https://swang.miccai.cloud/">Prof. Shuo Wang</a> and <a href="https://miccai.fudan.edu.cn/34225/list.htm">Prof. Zhijian Song</a>.
Previously, I received my B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2021, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sTQwwu4AAAAJ">Prof. Yanjie Wang</a>.

üìö My research interest includes Multimodal Perception, Weakly-supervised Learning and Meical Image Processing. I have published 15+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e_lRvJ8AAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fzwyang6%2Fzwyang6.github.io%2Fgoogle-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals such as CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, MICCAI, TMM, eta.
